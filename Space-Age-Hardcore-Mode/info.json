    "description": "Hard Mode is a modpack that tightens the gameplay of Space Age, removing shortcuts and adding interesting challenge.\n\nEach planet has significant variations. Vulcanus, Fulgora and Gleba have cargo drops disabled at first, and certain technologies are now locked behind building a small on-planet science chain.\n\nWe're looking for additional tweaks, please suggest them in Discord.",
