rocs-hardcore-gleba-move-forward-coal-synthesis=In vanilla, coal synthesis is unlocked by the Rocket Turret technology. However, it is usable earlier to create handheld rocket launchers on Gleba. This setting moves the coal synthesis recipe forward to be unlocked at the same time as the recipe to produce carbon from burnt spoilage.
