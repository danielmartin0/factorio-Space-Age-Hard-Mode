hard-nauvis-locomotive-fuel-spend-multiplier=Multiplier for locomotive fuel consumption. Higher values make locomotives consume more fuel.
hard-nauvis-half-mixed-ores=Every other iron, copper, coal and stone patch is mixed with the other types. The starting patches are unmixed. The ore ratios are the same as the vanilla game on average.
hard-nauvis-fully-mixed-ores=All iron, copper, coal and stone patches are mixed with each other. The ore ratios are the same as the vanilla game on average.
hard-nauvis-efficiency-module-effectiveness-multiplier=A value of 0.75 means that efficiency modules will be 25% less effective.
