  "description": "Difficulty tweaks for Fulgora. If 'V/F/G Cargo Drops Require Research' is installed, lightning rods are locked behind a new technology to incentivize building a small science chain on Fulgora – to compensate, oil walking speed is higher, solar panels are found in ruins and ruin attractors can be picked up and put down.\n\nOther dependencies are intended to be included, but all are listed as optional for maximum customizability. To get the full experience, enable this mod via the Space Age: Hard Mode modpack.",
