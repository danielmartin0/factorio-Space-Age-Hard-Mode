rocs-hardcore-fulgora-cargo-drops-need-research=Players and construction bots are exempted.
rocs-hardcore-fulgora-lightning-rods-need-research=Lightning rods cannot be built until a new technology is researched which requires automation, logistic, chemical and electromagnetic science packs. Solar panels are provided in ruin entities for an initial power source, plus extra ice in scrap. As with other Space Age: Hard Mode mods, this incentivizes a small science build prior to launching a rocket.
rocs-hardcore-fulgora-make-ruins-placeable=Fulgoran lightning collectors are no longer destroyed when mined.
